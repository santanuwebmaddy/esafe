In particular,&nbsp;[we] OR [I]&nbsp;aim to give you strong controls on&nbsp;[our] OR [my]&nbsp;use of your data for direct marketing purposes (including the ability to opt-out of receiving emails from&nbsp;[us] OR [me]&nbsp;which you may do by unsubscribing using the links provided in&nbsp;[our] OR [my]&nbsp;emails&nbsp;[and] OR [,]&nbsp;at the point of providing your details&nbsp;[and by managing your Account]).<br />You may also wish to sign up to one or more of the preference services operating in the UK: The Telephone Preference Service (&ldquo;the TPS&rdquo;), the Corporate Telephone Preference Service (&ldquo;the CTPS&rdquo;), and the Mailing Preference Service (&ldquo;the MPS&rdquo;).
